# Security_Project

This project offers the ability to encrypt and decrypt data through three commands:
1. Caesar Command
2. Permutation Command
3. Numerical Command


# Description of commands

1. Caesar Command
      This command moves each plaintext(original text) letter to several positions in the alphabet

2. Permutation Command 
      This command transforms plaintext to block level by moving characters according to a permutation.
      Permutation represents the displacement positions within the block. 
      Unfulfilled blocks of character character, e.g. with "x" or "w".
 
3. Numerical Command
      With this command each letter is replaced with its alphabetical position. 
      Thus letter "a" is encoded subdomain1, letter "b" subdomain2,    etc.
 
 
 # How to use 
 
 There
 
 After your open this program you will be asked to choose which program you're gonna use
 You have three choices:
 1. Caesar Command
2. Permutation Command
3. Numerical Command

After you choose one of commands above you have to choose what do you want to do with that command :

1. To Encrypt the plaintext or
2. To Decrypt the encrypted text 

Then , depending on what you have choosed you have to write the data or also the key(depending on the choice)


After opening the program you will get more information about using these commands.
