# Security_Project

This project offers the ability to encrypt and decrypt data through three commands:
1. Caesar Command
2. Permutation Command
3. Numerical Command


# Description of commands

1. Caesar Command

      This command moves each plaintext(original text) letter to several positions in the alphabet

2. Permutation Command 

      This command transforms plaintext to block level by moving characters according to a permutation.
      Permutation represents the displacement positions within the block. 
      Unfulfilled blocks of character character, e.g. with "x" or "w".
 
3. Numerical Command

      With this command each letter is replaced with its alphabetical position. 
      Thus letter "a" is encoded subdomain1, letter "b" subdomain2,    etc.


# Instructions for using the program

1. Choose one of the commands provided above

2. Choose encryption or decryption

3. Print data (Depending on which command you choose, data is required)

4. If you need more information you can use the help command 

5. Be sure to type in the correct arguments for the desired results

6. Down below you have some photos of executing commands -HAVE A LOOK
